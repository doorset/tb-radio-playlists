# tb-radio-playlists
A collection of playlists/radios that can be contributed by players for JCIT.

## Files
Stream Radio will only accept certain filetypes; those that end in ```_m3u.txt``` or ```_pls.txt``` .  
Examples: ```file-name_m3u.txt``` ```file_name_pls.txt```

VLC has the ability make these playlists for you, but you must do the work and replace the links within the file, as well as add the appropriate name/file extension.

## Folders
Characters must be all lowercase and alphanumeric. No spaces, use underscores or dashes instead.  
Examples: ```folder``` ```folder-name``` ```folder_name```

## Rules
* Users are only allowed 1 folder or file within the ```community``` folder.
* Users can create as many folders/files as they wish, as long as they have their own folder within the ```community``` folder.
* No annoying/inappropriate audio within the playlists.

# Contribution Instructions:
The Github Desktop App is useful for this. Make a pull request with the files you want to add/modify, and I will get to it ASAP.

If you need additional help or you have questions, wizerd can assist you on the JCIT Discord server.
